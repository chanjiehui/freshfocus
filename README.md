## � Project Description

### Problem Statement

Over **one-third of all food produced globally is wasted** — amounting to 1.3 billion tonnes per year. At the household level, most waste happens simply because people forget what they have, lose track of expiry dates, or don't know what to cook with near-expiry ingredients. This leads to unnecessary spending, unnecessary landfill waste, and unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions.

FreshFocus addresses this problem by acting as an intelligent, always-on fridge companion. It eliminates the mental overhead of tracking ingredients manually, and uses AI to turn "what's in my fridge?" into actionable answers: what's expiring, what to cook, and what to buy next.

### Purpose

FreshFocus empowers everyday households to:
- **See** what they have and what's about to expire at a glance
- **Act** on near-expiry ingredients by getting personalised recipe suggestions
- **Understand** their consumption habits through waste analytics
- **Plan** smarter with a real-time synced shopping list

---

## 🌍 Alignment with AI & UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

### How FreshFocus Uses AI

FreshFocus integrates **Google Gemini**, a state-of-the-art large multimodal model, at two critical points in the user journey:

1. **Vision AI (Fridge Scanning)** — Users take a photo of their fridge. Gemini analyses the image and returns a structured list of detected ingredients, estimated quantities, and predicted shelf life — removing the need for manual entry entirely.
2. **Generative AI (Recipe Generation)** — Given the user's ingredient inventory, dietary restrictions, and fitness goals, Gemini generates personalised recipes that deliberately prioritise near-expiry ingredients to close the loop on waste.

AI is not a bolt-on feature here — it is the core mechanism that makes the product effortless. Without it, the friction of manual inventory management would prevent adoption.

### SDG Alignment

| SDG | How FreshFocus Contributes |
|---|---|
| **SDG 2 — Zero Hunger** | Smarter food use at home stretches budgets further, improving food security for low-income households |
| **SDG 3 — Good Health & Well-being** | Nutritional balance tracking and personalised recipes encourage healthier eating habits |
| **SDG 12 — Responsible Consumption & Production** | Directly tackles household food waste — one of the largest contributors to Target 12.3 (halving per-capita food waste by 2030) |
| **SDG 13 — Climate Action** | Reducing food waste cuts methane emissions from landfills and lowers the carbon footprint of food production |

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. AI Fridge Scanning

The camera modal uses the **browser MediaDevices API** (`getUserMedia` with `facingMode: 'environment'`) to access the device's rear camera. A canvas element captures each frame, encodes it as a base64 JPEG, and submits it to **Gemini's multimodal endpoint**. Crucially, the response is enforced using Gemini's `responseSchema` config — guaranteeing a structured JSON array and eliminating unpredictable freeform output.

```typescript
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: [{ inlineData: { mimeType: "image/jpeg", data: base64Image } }, { text: prompt }],
  config: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseSchema: { type: Type.ARRAY, items: { /* name, quantity, estimatedDaysLeft */ } }
  }
});
```

#### 2. AI Recipe Generation

Recipes are generated by constructing a prompt from the live ingredient list (including expiry risk labels) and the user's stored preferences. Gemini is instructed to prioritise `'soon'` and `'expired'` ingredients. The response schema enforces full recipe structure (name, description, instructions, prep time, health indicators, tags).

#### 3. Real-time Firestore Sync (Loop Prevention)

Three `onSnapshot` listeners run concurrently for ingredients, shopping list, and preferences. A `isRemoteUpdate` React ref prevents write-back loops: when Firestore pushes data, the flag is set before state is updated, and save `useEffect` hooks skip writing if the change came from Firestore.

#### 4. Expiry Risk Classification

| Status | Days Remaining | Colour |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Fresh | > 7 days | Emerald |
| 🟡 Use Soon | 1–7 days | Amber |
| 🔴 Expired | 0 days | Rose |

Expiry is computed dynamically at render time from an ISO date string — not stored as a static counter — ensuring accuracy regardless of when the ingredient was added.

### Innovation

FreshFocus innovates at the **intersection of computer vision, generative AI, and behaviour change**:

- **Zero-friction onboarding**: The AI fridge scanner means users don't have to type a single ingredient to get started — a major barrier in traditional inventory apps.
- **Closed-loop waste reduction**: AI is used at both ends — detecting what's there *and* suggesting what to do with it before it expires.
- **Structured AI outputs**: Using Gemini's native JSON schema enforcement (not regex parsing) produces reliable, type-safe data that integrates seamlessly with the TypeScript data layer.
- **Real-time multi-device sync**: Firestore listeners make FreshFocus feel like a native app across phones, tablets, and desktops without any backend code.

---

### Challenges Faced

#### 1. Real-time Sync Write-back Loop
**Problem:** Firestore `onSnapshot` and `useEffect` save hooks created an infinite loop — every Firestore update triggered a re-save.  
**Solution:** An `isRemoteUpdate` ref flag marks Firestore-originated state changes so save effects are skipped.

#### 2. AI Response Reliability
**Problem:** LLMs can return malformed JSON, especially for nested schemas like recipes.  
**Solution:** Gemini's `responseMimeType: "application/json"` + `responseSchema` configuration enforces structured output at the API level, with `try/catch` fallbacks for edge cases.

#### 3. Expiry Date Drift
**Problem:** Storing days-remaining as a static integer caused stale expiry statuses over time.  
**Solution:** `calculateDaysLeft(dateString)` recomputes remaining days from an ISO date string relative to today on every render.

#### 4. Mobile Camera Access
**Problem:** Not all browsers default to the rear-facing camera.  
**Solution:** `getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: 'environment' } })` explicitly requests the rear camera, with graceful error handling for denied permissions.

#### 5. State Initialisation Race Condition
**Problem:** Save effects fired before Firestore finished loading, overwriting cloud data with empty local state.  
**Solution:** An `initialLoadComplete` boolean flag gates all save effects until all three Firestore listeners have received their first snapshot.
